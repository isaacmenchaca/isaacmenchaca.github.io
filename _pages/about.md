Greetings,

My name is Isaac, and I am a Bioengineering graduate from the University of California, Riverside.

I am currently involved with Dr. Megan Peters's Cognitive and Neural Computation Lab (UCI), observing fMRI data to better understand metacognition via perceptual decision making.

My domains of interest consists of data science, machine learning/ AI, biosignals, and cognitive neuroscience. My current goal is to extract information from neuroimaging data via machine learning to better understand metacognition in neurotypical individuals and those with cognitive disabilities.

My overall, long-term goal is to continue working on projects to better understand and improve underlying health issues via the power of data.

Besides research and skill-building, I like reading, soccer (Juventus fan), keeping up with modern music, and giving guidance to the youth of my community.

Feel free to message about any questions, or to discuss similar interests. :)


Best,
