Greetings,

My name is Isaac, and I am a Bioengineering graduate from the University of California, Riverside.

I am currently involved with Dr. Megan Peters's Cognitive and Neural Computation Lab (UCI), observing fMRI data to better understand metacognition via subjective confidence and perceptual decision making. I plan to continue making contributions and become skillful with real-time fMRI, such as decoded neurofeedback (decnef), to improve or understand cognition abilities and deficiencies. My long-term goal is to continue working on real-time fMRI projects for the use of clinical research.

Besides research and skill-building, I like reading, soccer (Juventus fan), photography, music, and providing mentorship.

Feel free to message about any questions, or to discuss similar interests!

Best,
