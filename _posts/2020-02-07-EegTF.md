The short-time FFT (STFT) is a simple extension of the Fourier Transform (FFT). It is a method for extracting time-frequency power and phase information from a signal. The STFT can be used for EEG data to investigate the time-varying changes in the frequency structure of task data.

I implemented a pipeline for transforming EEG data that has been saved in a .mat file from EEGLAB. The Time-Frequency Decomposition via STFT is implemented in python. The reason for the use of both Matlab and python is simply due to the ease of use of the EEGLAB GUI in regards to epoching data, filtering frequencies, and preprocessing signals. Python on the other hand has amazing online support for machine learning/ deep learning, so formatting the data in python would be beneficial in order to use popular libraries such as Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow for insight on the data.

Wavelet Transformation (WT) was also considered, but on different circumstances, there have been trade-offs in classification accuracy in different Time-Frequency (TF) Decomposition methods. Wavelet Transformation for example may produce different accuracy results based on its mother/ basis functions (e.g. Morlet, Guassian, Mexican Hat) and the classification task [^fn1]. Nonetheless, it has also been observed that the STFT, Hilbert Transform, and Wave Transform methods yield formally equivalent results in practical applications to neuronal signals [^fn2]. So having multiple different methods to enhance classification accuracy of certain cognitive tasks seemed personally desirable.

#### How the STFT Works
If you understand how the FFT works, STFT is straight forward. Instead of using the FFT to extract the frequency structure of the entire EEG signal, the STFT takes the FFT of the signal in brief segments known as time windows. Fig. 1 demonstrates the process: (A) A small segment of the signal is used comprising a time window of a few hundred milliseconds. (B) This segment of data is then tapered to avoid edge artifacts. A hann window is used for this example, but there are other window tapers that can be used. Different windows can be tested, but it's unlikely to yield significantly different results from the hann window. (C) The FFT is then performed on the tapered data segment. The FFT will return frequencies up to the Nyquist Frequency (sampling rate / 2). (D) The power spectrum of that segment is then placed into a time-frequency space with the frequencies corresponding to the FFT and the time point corresponding to the center time point of the time segment in (B).

#### stft4EegChannel: EEG STFT Function Information

The code for the function can be located [here](https://github.com/isaacmenchaca/isaacmenchaca-Computational-Cognitive-Neuroscience/blob/master/TFDecomp/EegTF.py).

Currently the stft4EegChannel function takes an EEG .mat file from EEGLAB as an input to retrieve appropriate information (sampling rate, time, channels, epoch trials), but the code can be adjusted to input this information manually -- something that can be done in the future.

To use the function, EegTF must be imported to use the **stft4EegChannel**.
**stft4EegChannel** has the following inputs:

* **fileName: str**: The path of the .mat file.
* **channel: str**: The desired channel, e.g. 'Fz'.
* **timeStep (ms): int**: The timestep of the STFT. How much time it slides over from the previous window.
* **startTime (ms): int**: The start time of the Time-Frequency Decomposition from the original signal.
* **endTime (ms): int**: The end time of the Time-Frequency Decomposition from the original signal.
* **windowSize (ms): int**: The size of the window that will be used to undergo FFT.
* **desiredStartTime (ms): int**: The desired start time to be extracted from the TF Decomposition. Default is None.
* **desiredEndTime (ms): int**: The desired end time to be extracted from the TF Decomposition. Default is None.
* **trial_epoch: int**: The epoch trial to perform the STFT on. Default is None, indicating only one trial available.
* **frequencyStop: int**: Low-pass filter. Will only obtain frequencies up to this point for TF Decomposition. Default is None.
* **windowTaper :str**: The window taper to use. Based on available scipy windows. Default = 'hann'.
* **log_power: bool**: Option to log-transform the power axis. Default = True.
* **plot_data: str**: Determines the type of plot to output. 'All' plots both the EEG signal and the TF representation without the colorbar. 'All_cb' plots EEG signal and TF with the colorbar. 'tf' plots the TF with a colorbar. 'tf_3d' plots the TF representation in 3D axes. Default = 'All'.
* **scaling: str**: Determines the scale of the power. 'density' sets the scale to units of of V ** 2 / Hz. 'spectrum' sets the scale to units of of V ** 2. Default = 'spectrum'.

The function returns:
* **tf_frequency: np.array**: The frequency of the TF decomposition from desired time span or original input time span.
* **tf_time: np.array**: The time of the TF decomposition from desired time span or original input time span.
* **tf_power: np.array**: The power of the TF decomposition from desired time span or original input time span.

An important thing to mention is the purpose of the desiredStartTime  and desiredEndTime  parameters. Without these parameters, the signal with its input start and end times will be extended and zero-padded so that every part of the signal is included in the TF Decomposition. This forces the input start time as the first time window and the input end time as the last window in the Time-Frequency domain via STFT.

Instead of extending and zero-padding the desired signal time frame, you can overshoot the times of the input signal and extract the desired time frame for the TF Decomposition. You can do this by elongating the startTime and endTime parameters by the window size of the STFT divided by 2 on each ends.
